Hello and welcome to my presentation!

Today, I want to encourage Software Engineers everywhere to not be discouraged with the rise of AI software. If anything, I want you to learn how to ride the wave of AI technology so that you can adapt just as fast as other AI-enabled software engineers and companies.

I'll share my first project as a freelance engineer and how I used AI tools, and, most importantly, how not to use AI technology. AI Technology is useful and impressive, but if it's misused it can hinder progress as a software engineer.

I'll cover for key lessons.

1. Learning the technology that you're developing with the assistance of AI.
2. Leveraging AI technology in the most useful and beneficial why possible.
3. Mastering software engineering so that the AI doesn't master you.

I hope this presentation will be engaging, insightful, and memorable.

Speaking of fun, I want to recognize that we are in a movie theater. This is a place where people come to be told inspirational stories, and occasionally people dress up to participate in that story. I've never had that experience of dressing up for a movie premiere, so I want to take that opportunity now.

I am dressed in a wizard outfit! I hope this doesn't distract from my presentation too much, so I will try and make this presentation professional as possible still.

But still, I think there needs to be a little _magic_.

I have hear my _wand_.

Very good. Let's move on.
