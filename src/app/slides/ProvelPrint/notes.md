About a two years ago, I was visiting my in-laws in Washington. One of those in-laws was my wife's aunt and uncle. It was a nice visit; we got to talking about how life went. At one point of the conversation, my wife's aunt, Barbara, turned to me and asked if I knew anything about desktop software. This surprised me because I didn't think that Barbara knew much about software in general.

I replied that I didn't know much because I haven't worked in it at all. But I imagine that I could learn pretty quick.

Barbara told me that she discovered through a weird network connection that I could have a freelance job. That network connection was her friend's barber's other friend. Barbara asked if she could share my contact info with her friend's barber's other friend, and this friend would contact me.

A little while later, I got a message from this friend's barber's other friend who introduced himself as David. He asked if I knew much about desktop applications and 3D rendering. I responded that I didn't know much in a desktop environment, but I knew more in a browser environment. David sighed saying that for the moment he would need to go in the direction of desktop technology.

This meant no freelance job.

As it turned out, about one year ago David reached out to me again asking if I would have interest in taking the job but with the focus on starting a browser version. This was exciting. I've never done a freelance job before, neither have I done anything with 3D rendering in the browser. After some documentation exchanges, I agreed to take the job. David would pay me hourly, and I would send him invoices for the work that I did.
