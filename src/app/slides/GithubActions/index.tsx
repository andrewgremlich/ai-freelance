				Utilizing AI to accelerate comprehension of unfamiliar technologies and
				methodologies. I wrote a github action with the aid of AI. It didn't
				help much because I didn't know what I was doing, but it was a good
				learning.

				Converting a large JS file to TS was a challenge, because AI didn't
				convert the whole file. It missed some functions. I would have though
				this is a good implementation for AI, but it wasn't. I had to do it
				manually.
