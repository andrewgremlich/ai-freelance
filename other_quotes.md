In another study, software engineers slowed down significantly when using AI on a large codebase, because the AI could not fully grasp the complexities of a large codebase. Other studies found that AI could definitely help speed up smaller more concise tasks. Other studies found that workers were less motivated for their job when using AI.

> Our findings consistently demonstrated that collaboration with GenAI enhanced immediate task performance. However, this performance augmentation effect did not persist in subsequent tasks performed independently by humans. Importantly, transitioning from collaboration with GenAI to solo work led to an increased sense of control of human workers, and was also accompanied by significant decreases in intrinsic motivation and increases in feelings of boredom. These results highlight the complex dual effects of human-GenAI collaboration: It enhances immediate task performance but can undermine long-term psychological experiences of human workers.

> While no occupation exists where GenAI can entirely substitute human roles, there remain tasks that can be better executed by human workers. The future of employment is more likely to evolve towards a hybrid model, where individuals switch between collaborating with GenAI and working independently. This evolving hybrid work dynamic highlights the need for work redesign and effective task allocation within a job role. In particular, GenAI is increasingly being integrated into tasks that require creativity and problem-solving, complementing human capabilities in producing high-quality outputs.



### Large Language Models Do Not Simulate Human Psychology

> Still, the core function of any LLM is to simply predict the probability of each possible next word (more precisely: the next token), randomly select the next word according to the predicted probabilities, and continue until all desired text is generated – with no explicit regard for meaning or truth

> However, the increased use of LLMs has also been accompanied by a wave of research regarding limitations and risks of such models, especially in terms of failures in reasoning, bias and de-skilling of researchers when over-relying on LLM assistance

### MIT report: 95% of generative AI pilots at companies are failing

> But where it gets interesting is what the NANDA study said about the apparent reasons for these failures. The biggest problem, the report found, was not that the AI models weren’t capable enough (although execs tended to think that was the problem.) Instead, the researchers discovered a “learning gap”—people and organizations simply did not understand how to use the AI tools properly or how to design workflows that could capture the benefits of AI while minimizing downside risks.

> Ethan Mollick has suggested that the real benefits of AI will come when companies abandon trying to get AI models to follow existing processes—many of which he argues reflect bureaucracy and office politics more than anything else—and simply let the models find their own way to produce the desired business outcomes.

> Some large companies’ pilots and younger startups are really excelling with generative AI,” Challapally said. Startups led by 19- or 20-year-olds, for example, “have seen revenues jump from zero to $20 million in a year,” he said. “It’s because they pick one pain point, execute well, and partner smartly with companies who use their tools [...] But for 95% of companies in the dataset, generative AI implementation is falling short. The core issue? Not the quality of the AI models, but the “learning gap” for both tools and organizations. While executives often blame regulation or model performance, MIT’s research points to flawed enterprise integration. Generic tools like ChatGPT excel for individuals because of their flexibility, but they stall in enterprise use since they don’t learn from or adapt to workflows
