Hello and welcome to my presentation! Thank you for coming!

Today, I want to encourage Software Engineers everywhere to not be discouraged with the rise of AI software. If anything, I want you to learn how to ride the wave of AI technology so that you can adapt just as fast as other AI-enabled software engineers and companies.

I'll share my first project as a freelance engineer and how I used AI tools, and, most importantly, how not to use AI technology. AI Technology is useful and impressive, but if it's misused it can hinder progress as a software engineer.

I'll cover four key lessons.

1. Learning the technology that you're developing with the assistance of AI.
2. Leveraging AI technology in the most useful and beneficial why possible.
3. Mastering software engineering so that the AI doesn't master you.

I hope this presentation will be engaging, insightful, and memorable.

Speaking of fun, I recognize that we are in a movie theater. This is a place where people come to be told inspirational stories, and occasionally people dress up to participate in that story. I've never had that experience of dressing up for a movie premiere, so I want to take that opportunity now.

_PULL OUT WIZARD OUTFIT_

A few months ago I fell in love with a cloak off of Etsy, so I purchased it. Naturally I also had to purchase a wizard hat.

I'm in a wizard outfit! I hope this doesn't distract from my presentation too much, so I will try and make this presentation professional still.

And yet, if I'm in a wizard outfit, I think there needs to be a little bit of _magic_ in this presentation. I'm here to have some fun, and I hope you all have some fun as well.

I have here my _wand_.

It's taken me some time to learn how to use this to produce magic, but I believe I can have a go at it.

_ACTIVATE MAGIC MODE_

Ah it's working. Very good. Let's move on.

About a two years ago, I was visiting my in-laws in Washington. One of those in-laws was my wife's aunt and uncle. It was a nice visit; we got to talking about how life went. At one point of the conversation, my wife's aunt, Barbara, turned to me and asked if I knew anything about desktop software. This surprised me because I didn't think that Barbara knew much about software in general.

I replied that I didn't know much about desktop specifically because I haven't worked in it professionally. But I imagine that I could learn pretty quick, because such is the nature of being a software engineer now-a-days. On top of that, I was familiar with Electron and various frameworks that could help.

Barbara told me that she discovered through a weird network connection that I could have a freelance job. That network connection was her friend's barber's other friend. Barbara asked if she could share my contact info with her friend's barber's other friend, and this friend would contact me.

A little while later, I got a message from this friend who introduced himself as David. He asked if I knew much about desktop applications and 3D rendering. I responded that I didn't know much in a desktop specific environment, but I knew more related to web technology and I could learn more. David sighed saying that for the moment he would need to go in the direction of desktop technology.

This meant no freelance job.

As it turned out, about one year ago David reached out to me again asking if I would still have interest in taking the job but with the focus on starting a browser version. This was exciting. I've never done a freelance job before, neither have I done anything with 3D rendering in the browser. By my excitement, I agreed to take the job. David would pay me hourly, and I would send him invoices for the work that I did. I did come to realize that my excitement was probably a little faster than my realism.

_CHANGE SLIDE: Learning_

I had no idea how to approach this project. I had to learn several different things: 3D Tech, Slicing, and Github Actions.

My first approach to learn about 3D was to look up the work that other people have done. I found several slicer software, custom independently made and professionally made slicers.

### Github Actions

Utilizing AI to accelerate comprehension of unfamiliar technologies and
methodologies. I wrote a github action with the aid of AI. It didn't
help much because I didn't know what I was doing, but it was a good
learning.

Converting a large JS file to TS was a challenge, because AI didn't
convert the whole file. It missed some functions. I would have though
this is a good implementation for AI, but it wasn't. I had to do it
manually.

### Whooshes

Discuss the use of whooshes in the project and how AI didn't help. It was a basic React mistake by putting an array in an useEffect dependency.

- But the new METR study shows that those gains donâ€™t apply to all software development scenarios. In particular, this study showed that experienced developers intimately familiar with the quirks and requirements of large, established open source codebases experienced a slowdown.
