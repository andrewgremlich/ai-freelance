Hello and welcome to my presentation! Thank you for coming!

Today, I want to encourage Software Engineers everywhere to not be discouraged or stressed out with the rise of AI software. If anything, I want you to learn how to ride the wave of AI technology so that you can adapt just as fast as other AI-enabled software engineers and companies.

I'll share my first project as a freelance engineer and how I used AI tools, and, most importantly, how not to use AI technology. AI Technology is useful and impressive, but if it's misused it can hinder progress as a software engineer.

I'll cover four key lessons.

1. Learning the technology that you're developing with the assistance of AI.
2. Leveraging AI technology in the most useful and beneficial why possible.
3. Mastering software engineering so that the AI doesn't master you.

I hope this presentation will be engaging, insightful, and memorable.

## CostumeChange

Speaking of fun, I recognize that we are in a movie theater. This is a place where people come to be told inspirational stories, and occasionally people dress up to participate in that story. I've never had that experience of dressing up for a movie premiere, so I want to take that opportunity now.

_PULL OUT WIZARD OUTFIT_

A few months ago I fell in love with a cloak off of Etsy, so I purchased it. Naturally I also had to purchase a wizard hat.

I'm in a wizard outfit! I hope this doesn't distract from my presentation too much, so I will try and make this presentation professional still.

And yet, if I'm in a wizard outfit, I think there needs to be a little bit of _magic_ in this presentation. I'm here to have some fun, and I hope you all have some fun as well.

I have here my _wand_.

_PULL OUT JOYCON_

It's taken me some time to learn how to use this to produce magic, but I believe I can have a go at it.

_ACTIVATE MAGIC MODE_

Ah it's working. Very good. Let's move on.

## Meditate

I hope you guys in attendance won't mind that I do this next part. I've programmed this orb to the timing of _box breathing_.

Box breathing is a form of breathing meditation where you inhale for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, hold your breath for for seconds, and then repeat as many times as you like or need. Because each of the 4 steps is 4 seconds long is the reason why it's called box breathing, with a box having for equal length sides. There are other forms of breathing meditation, if you're curious to look at it later.

I want to introduce box breathing because one of the benefits of meditation is stress management. When I first started my career out of college, so many new things happened to cause me stress: I was going into something new and unfamiliar, I had to learn how to work in the software engineering field, and my mother had recently passed away. It seemed as if I could explode at the stress any minute. I complained and vented to my friends, and I felt deeply that I needed to get this handled, no matter how much I thought my stress was justified.

I went to a NodeJS conference in San Francisco where a speaker promoted meditation to help stress management. This did pique my interest, so I downloaded Headspace to try meditation. After one practice session, I immediately felt how relaxed I got. With this small segment, I hope to inspire proper stress management, and all the better if it's meditation.

Now allow me to explain how breathing meditation works by the two sides of the nervous system, sympathetic and parasympathetic. Sympathetic nervous system is activated in the height of stress, so the heart rate increases and other factors occur to help an individual fight or flight. The parasympathetic nervous system is activated in rest periods. This is where the parasympathetic nervous system encourages the body to rest, rebuild, and recover. A good indicator of which nervous system is activated is how fast you're breathing. If you notice your breaths are short or you're holding your breath, then you're probably in a sympathetic nervous system state. If your breaths are long and relaxed, you're probably in the parasympathetic nervous system. And it is by being aware of one's own breathing one may trigger relaxation in the nervous system.

*CAN SKIP* Sympathetic starts with "S" and "S" stands for stress, and "Parasympathetic" starts with "P" and "P" stands for peace. Or for imagery, a "S" could be for sprinting where the heart rate goes faster, and "P" can be for panda where a panda is peaceful.

In today's age where the software engineering industry is in flux, things can be stressful. I would really enjoy it if I can get everyone here to do a quick one minute meditation with me following box breathing pattern in order to de-stress about the industry.

_ONE MINUTE BOX BREATHING_

Thank you.

You all are now under my spell!

Just kidding.

## Project

About a two years ago, I was visiting my in-laws in Washington. One of those in-laws was my wife's aunt and uncle. It was a nice visit; we got to talking about how life went. At one point of the conversation, my wife's aunt, Barbara, turned to me and asked if I knew anything about desktop software. This surprised me because I didn't think that Barbara knew much about software in general.

I replied that I didn't know much about desktop specifically because I haven't worked in it professionally. But I imagine that I could learn pretty quick, because such is the nature of being a software engineer now-a-days. On top of that, I was familiar with Electron and various frameworks that could potentially help.

Barbara told me that she discovered through a weird connection that I could have a freelance job. This connection was her friend's barber's other friend. Barbara asked if she could share my contact info with her friend's barber's other friend, and this friend would contact me.

A little while later, I got a message from this friend who introduced himself as David. He asked if I knew much about desktop applications and 3D rendering. I responded that I didn't know much in a desktop specific environment, but I knew more related to web technology and I could learn more about desktop environments. David sighed saying that for the moment he would need to go in the direction of desktop technology.

As it turned out, about one year ago David reached out to me again asking if I would still have interest in taking the job but with the focus on starting a browser version. This was exciting. I've never done a freelance job before, neither have I done anything with 3D rendering in the browser. By my excitement, I agreed to take the job. David would pay me hourly, and I would send him invoices for the work that I did. I did come to realize that my excitement was probably a little faster than my realism.

David called the project ProvelPrint and he explained that the project involved importing an STL file into the application and slicing that STL file so that a custom made 3D printer could render it.

## Learning

### Github Actions

Utilizing AI to accelerate comprehension of unfamiliar technologies and
methodologies. I wrote a github action with the aid of AI. It didn't
help much because I didn't know what I was doing, but it was a good
learning.

Converting a large JS file to TS was a challenge, because AI didn't
convert the whole file. It missed some functions. I would have though
this is a good implementation for AI, but it wasn't. I had to do it
manually.

### Whooshes

Discuss the use of whooshes in the project and how AI didn't help. It was a basic React mistake by putting an array in an useEffect dependency.

## Freelance Project

Right, I didn't know what problems I needed to solve. David talked about slicers, so I guessed I better learn the functions of a slicer. I searched around the internet for what slicers were and what projects used a slicing method. I found that a slicer was a way to divide up a 3D model into a pattern that makes it 3D-printable. This is usually done in layers at a time. In addition, I found out that infill was a way to build support for any hanging edges of a model. Some projects that I found involved Three.JS, so I would go in that direction first and use Three.JS.

The more I explored slicers and had David explain to me what he wanted, bit by bit I started to understand the task. At this time, I still was in over my head though. In one attempted solution, I asked ChatGPT to create a slicer function using all the points of an STL file. I ended up getting something that worked on paper, but the more I examined the GCode output the more I realized that this output could not reasonably fit the customer needs. The hints that told me this wasn't the right way was: the output GCode file was immensely huge, and that just could not work in transmission; the print needed to be in vase mode where the nozzle height gradually increases; and the height difference between STL points was not configurable. I told David that I needed to redo the slicer and he did give me some pushback. I successfully convinced him that what I was doing wasn't the right way to go and I needed to pivot.

Eventually, I started to teach myself some 3D animation principles, and I found out about raycasters. Raycasters are incredibly useful to help calculate intersections of light rays and 3D objects in a scene. Intersection calculation was what I needed, and Three.JS had a built-in raycaster object and intersection calculation! Taking this knowledge, I solved that I needed to place the raycaster origin at the center of an STL model and rotate the raycaster on its origin to find where the intersection point would be. After rotating the raycaster and gradually increasing in height, to imitate vase print mode, I would gather all the intersection points and process them into the desired GCode output.

After a couple weeks of development, spending about 5-10 hours a week on the project, I finally got to the desired output. I felt so satisfied that I followed my gut instinct on how the original solution just wouldn't work. By this experience, it started to teach me the limitations of having AI do _all the work_ when I don't know myself what problem it is I needed to solve.

## Leveraging

How can I properly leverage AI technology to help my work?

As I learned from my freelance job, I could only properly leverage AI technology when I knew what I wanted to do. I had no idea on the technical aspects of a slicer. But once I learned the technical aspects of a slicer, then I would properly word directions to an AI bot to generate something for me. Additionally, I found that if I had no idea what the code was doing, it took me longer to figure out where a problem was.

I believe my experience in my freelance job isn't the only thing that have a say here.

A research group at MIT wanted to find how students would perform when using an LLM and when not using an LLM on an essay. Students were separated into three different groups: able to use ChatGPT, able to use Google, and only write using their brain. Once the essays were written and submitted, the students were able to review their papers swapping tools. The students that used ChatGPT couldn't use ChatGPT, the people that used Google couldn't use Google, and the people that just used their brain could use ChatGPT.

The group that only used an LLM in writing an essay demonstrated poor memory recall and less brain wave activity while writing and reviewig the essay. The group that did not write using an LLM but reviewed their work using an LLM showed higher memory recall and more brain activity. This study essentially found that group that defaulted to using the LLM performed worse than the group that didn't use an LLM. This does not mean that using an LLM makes you dumber, but rather in means that defaulting to an LLM first encourages you to not be invested in the work that you're doing.

In the additional notes, graders found the LLM essays to be "soul-less". The essays also commonly used similar phrasing and structure patterns.

What do I think this means? I think it means software engineers shouldn't default to using AI first if they want to get better at their job. A software engineer needs to learn the task they're doing, and then code the task when they are solid in the idea they want. AI technology can be used as a supped up linter to suggest coding changes.

This wasn't the only thing that I found.

In another study, software engineers slowed down significantly when using AI on a large codebase, because the AI could not fully grasp the complexities of a large codebase. Other studies found that AI could definitely help speed up smaller more concise tasks. Other studies found that workers were less motivated for their job when using AI.

## Mastering

Recent Hasan Minhaj had an interview with Neil deGrasse Tyson, and in one part of that interview Neil expressed his view of AI technology and how overrated the technology is becoming.

https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxtvyDjD-1rQFmjCcGQhibDGDGPMgqw6ea?si=u63QuTDtAAPAY1i4

"Be creative and find something that AI can't do, and make an industry out of that"

Neil deGrasse Tyson isn't worried about people not having jobs, because industries have been evolving and progressing for a while now.

I want to echo these exact same vibes. Exactly as I have learned in my freelance project and in these scientific studies, it is important to learn, leverage, and ultimately master an AI skill to speed up development.

## Knowing

## The Why

## Inspire

Eventually with my freelance project, I accomplished something that no other software engineer had done previously for David. He explained to me on several occasions that I was the fifth software engineer to tackle this project. All the previous software engineers had various problems with the project, and they couldn't deliver a finished product for David. David also had been working on this project for about 8 years. But even when I was discouraged from the lack of help from AI technology and lack of knowledge, I tackled the problems head on and I learned how to solve the problems. On one occasion David said this quote to me, explaining his motivation for keeping on moving. He knew that I was a hiker, so the metaphor landed well with me.

> When you're hiking, those little steps might not seem like much — but they're exactly what get you to the top.

The little things we do for our careers may not seem like much when compared to the massive driving force of AI technology, but it is precisely those small steps that make our own careers a human experience.
